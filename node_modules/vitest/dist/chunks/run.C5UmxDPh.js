/**
* @experimental
* @advanced
*
* Records a custom test artifact during test execution.
*
* This function allows you to attach structured data, files, or metadata to a test.
*
* Vitest automatically injects the source location where the artifact was created and manages any attachments you include.
*
* **Note:** artifacts must be recorded before the task is reported. Any artifacts recorded after that will not be included in the task.
*
* @param task - The test task context, typically accessed via `this.task` in custom matchers or `context.task` in tests
* @param artifact - The artifact to record. Must extend {@linkcode TestArtifactBase}
*
* @returns A promise that resolves to the recorded artifact with location injected
*
* @throws {Error} If the test runner doesn't support artifacts
*
* @example
* ```ts
* // In a custom assertion
* async function toHaveValidSchema(this: MatcherState, actual: unknown) {
*   const validation = validateSchema(actual)
*
*   await recordArtifact(this.task, {
